#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

One way to ensure that your code is safe, is to ensure that all of the testing techniques that you apply are up to date.  That is probably the one mose important aspect of protecting your code.  Out dated screening methods can leave vulnerabilities in that the updated version would address.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The customer should provide you with somekind of specification of what they require from the code.  It is always good practice to talk with the customer to ensure that the task at hand is clear.

#How do I approach designing software?

Approach it with an open mind.  Place yourself in the customer's shoes?  What and how would you want the code to do and function.  Use commen sense methods during your coding.  Most importantly, use good structure and architecture in your code.  This will make reading your code easy to understand if anohter programmer has to modify your code.
